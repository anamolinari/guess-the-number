## Project description

<p align="justify">
"Guess the Number" is a simple game in which the player has to guess a random number between 1 and 100.

The game was developed as part of a programming challenge, where the layout and interface were designed by a designer in Figma and implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a virtual keyboard to facilitate the input of guesses and a button styling to indicate that the key has been pressed.

Additionally, the game provides real-time visual feedback, indicating whether the player's guess was too high, too low or if they guessed the number correctly. Another interesting point is that the game has a maximum limit of 5 guesses per round, making each game even more challenging.

If the player is unable to guess the number within the 5 guesses, the game displays a message indicating that the limit has been reached. If the player guesses the number, the game congratulates them, and in both cases, a "play again" button is available on the screen.

## Features

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 1: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, which the player must guess within 5 attempts.

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 2: The player can input their guess through a virtual keyboard or the computer keyboard.

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 3: The game validates the player's guess, checking if the input value is within the allowed range (between 1 and 100) and if it is a valid number.

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 4: The game provides feedback to the player indicating if the guess was too high, too low, or if they guessed the number correctly.

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 5: The game also displays all the guesses made by the player so far, separated by a hyphen.

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 6: If the player guesses the number correctly, the game displays a victory message and offers the option to play again.

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 7: If the player is unable to guess the number within 5 attempts, the game displays a message indicating that the player has lost and offers the option to play again.

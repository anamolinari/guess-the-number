## Project description

<p align="justify">
The interface was developed in Figma and implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game has a maximum limit of 5 guesses per round and provides real-time feedback, indicating whether the number guessed was too high or too low.

If the player fails to guess the number within 5 attempts, a message appears on the screen indicating that the limit has been reached. On the other hand, if the player guesses the number correctly, a victory message is displayed, and in both cases, a "play again" button is available at the end of the game.

## Features

- The player has 5 chances to guess a random number between 1 and 100.
- This number is automatically generated through the code "Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;".
- It is possible to make a guess using the virtual keyboard, mouse, or the computer's physical keyboard.
- Letters, special characters, negative numbers, or numbers above 100 are not accepted.
- After each guess, feedback is displayed on the screen to inform whether the guess was high or low.
- The player's guess is displayed and remains visible on the screen.
- If the player guesses the random number correctly, they will be informed through a message on the screen.
- If the player does not guess the number within the 5 attempts, a defeat message is displayed.
- In both cases, the option to play again is available to the user.
- In addition to text, messages can also be distinguished by color: green for victory and red for defeat.
